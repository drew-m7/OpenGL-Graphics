# OpenGL Graphics Programming
- Computer graphics with openGl, glsl, c++, etc.
- This is a project I did for the final project of my Introduction to Computer Graphics class, implementing many advanced graphics techniques, such as texture mapping, transformations, camera movements, advanced Phong optical model lighting, cube maps, etc. 
- The rendering generated is a moving model of the solar system, which is intended to be as accurate as possible!
- This project is built in C++ along with openGL graphics shading language and CMake is needed to compile, configure, and generate the rendering for this project.
