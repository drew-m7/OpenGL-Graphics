# OpenGL Graphics Programming
Computer graphics with openGl, glsl, c++, etc.
This is a project I did for the final project of my Introduction to Computer Graphics class, implementing many advanced graphics techniques, such as texture mapping, transformations, camera movements, advanced Phong optical model lighting, cube maps, etc. 
The rendering generated is a moving model of the solar system, which is intended to be as accurate as possible!
